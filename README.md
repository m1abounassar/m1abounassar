## 🧠 About Me

I'm a systems-focused software engineer passionate about **scalable data pipelines**, **full-stack web apps**, and **AI-driven automation**.  
I love building production-ready systems that bridge backend logic, data engineering, and intuitive UI design.  

My career so far has spanned:
- ✈️ **Delta Air Lines** – Architecting AWS Glue/Lambda pipelines processing 50K+ crew records daily  
- 🛰️ **Department of Defense (Robins AFB)** – Building real-time avionics GUIs for radar and jamming systems  
- 🏫 **Georgia Tech Capstone** – Leading a full-stack React/Next.js course-enrollment app serving 8K+ students  
- 🧬 **UGA Kinesiology Department** – Applying ML to health sensor data (AUC 0.86) via Databricks pipelines  

Outside of work, I’m active in Georgia Tech’s **International Ambassador Program**, **GreyHat Cybersecurity**, and play **club-level golf and tennis**.
